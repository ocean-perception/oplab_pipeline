This is a toolchain for AUV dive processing, camera calibration and image correction.
Three main tools are used to get from the raw data to geolocalised and colour-corrected images for a particular dataset: `auv_nav <auv_nav.html>`_, `auv_cal <auv_cal.html>`_ and `correct_images <correct_images.html>`_.
